# FedEx Web Service for Zen Cart Mod

(Under development, for personal purposes only)

Note: FedEx doesn't provide new production keys any more (meter numbers). For new users, please check the REST API plug-in above. This mod is only for old users. 

This module is based on the Numinix FedEx Shipping Module, v1.9.1 with some modifications to support Zen Cart 1.5.8 and PHP 8.0. PHP 8.1 is not tested so probably it still works.

If unable to fix the warning, add "error_reporting(0);" to the top line.
