# FedEx Web Service for Zen Cart

(Under development, for personal purposes only)

This repository is the home of the FedEx Shipping Module, supporting Zen Cart 1.58 with PHP 8.0. This module is based on the Numinix plug-in, v1.8.1 

Original plug-in download Link: https://www.numinix.com/zen-cart-plugins-modules-shipping-c-179_250_373_163/fedex-web-services-shipping  

The original v1.8.1 plug-in is not compatible with PHP 8.0 and it will throw many errors and warnings. This modified plug-in seems to fix this issue.
